Operational procedure for Help Desk and the Escalation of problems
------------------------------------------------------------------

L1 Support is provided via the redmine portal on the address: https://utepredmine.it4i.cz/redmine/ The user is expected
to submit ticket in case something in the portal doesn't work the way it is expected to or he needs help with some of
the tasks. The L1 support is by default provided by Gisat who in case of bug tickets assign them to the relevant partners
in the consortium.

Usually this should mean that within a day the task will be assigned to somebody to solve it. If this doesn't happen
or there is stronger urgency than that it is possible to write email to the: support@gisat.cz. The subject of this message
should contain [UrbanTEP]

If there is still no answer even after that, it is possible to escalate via writing the email to the email address:
urban-tep@esa.int
