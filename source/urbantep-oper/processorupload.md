# Operational procedure for processor registration after upload

An expert user can upload a new processor to one of the processing centres using an automated upload script. Behind the scenes the actions are slightly different in both processing centres, and may be not fully automated. The upload script to the IT4I processing centre creates a ticket in behalf of the user. This ticket is necessary for the manual steps of the initial WPS configuration. Later updates of the same processor are automated in the IT4I processing centre as well. The deployment of processors in the BC processing centre is fully automated. If the user has not been entitled for the Test My Processor application and the trigger to insert new processors automatically has been set up with the expert user registration this has to be done once. Initially, the processor is only accessible by the user.

- The help desk operator is automatically informed about the new ticket. The operator forwards the ticket to the IT4I processing system operator, and to the portal operator if this is the first time the user requests upload of a processor.
- The IT4I processing centre operator configures the new processor into the WPS configuration to make it available to the portal.
- The Portal operator verifies that the user is entitled to use the Test My Processor application and that the trigger to automatically register new processors in the portal is configured.
- The help desk operator informs the user about the finalisation of the configuration.
