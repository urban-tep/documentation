Operational procedure for dataset publication
---------------------------------------------

An expert user may have processed a new dataset on the platform and wants to share it with a group (community) or publish it. The procedure may be initiated by an expert user filling the form in "Develop and offer content".

* The help desk operator is automatically informed about the new ticket.
* If necessary, the operator informs the Service Manager or the Management Board about the request and waits for a decision.
* The help desk operator informs the processing centre operator(s), the portal operator, and the visualisation and analysis tool operator.
* The processing centre operator configures access rights to the dataset as requested. This may include moving the dataset from the user area to a permanent storage and updates to the WMS and WPS configuration.
* In case of a public dataset the portal operator and the visualisation and analysis tool operator configure the new data source as new layer and optionally as application.
* The help desk operator informs the user about the finalisation of the configuration.
