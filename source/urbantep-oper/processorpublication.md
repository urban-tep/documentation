# Operational procedure for processor publication

An expert user may have tested a new processor on the platform and wants to share it with a group (community) or publish it. The procedure may be initiated by an expert user filling the form in "Develop and offer content".

- The help desk operator is automatically informed about the new ticket.
- If necessary, the operator informs the Service Manager or the Management Board about the request and waits for a decision.
- The help desk operator informs the processing centre operator(s) and the portal operator.
- The processing centre operator configures access rights to the processor as requested. This may include freezing the version and updates to the WPS configuration.
- In case of a public processor the portal operator configures the new processor as (part of) a new application.
- The help desk operator informs the user about the finalisation of the configuration.
