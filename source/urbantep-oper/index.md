# Urban TEP Operational Procedures

The Urban TEP operational procedures are instructions for the operators of the system. They describe the steps to be performed for partially automated workflows initiated by users. Usually, the procedures involve the user relationship management system (issue tracking) to trace the communication between user, help desk, and the operators of portal, processing centres, and the visualisation and analysis tool. In some cases governance of the Urban TEP is involved as well.
