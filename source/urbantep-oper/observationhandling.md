# Operational procedure for observation handing

Expert users are entitled to raise tickets in the ticket handling system in case of observations, issues etc. These observations may be handled as questions, non-conformance reports, or change requests. Because initially it is often not clear of which category an observation is all are initiated by a user the same way, using the ticket handling system.

- The help desk operator is automatically informed about the new ticket.
- If necessary, the operator communicates with the user and serves as first level support.
- If necessary, the help desk operator forwards the ticket to a processing system operator, portal operator, or visualisation and analysis tool operator (second level support).
- Questions shall be answered.
- NCRs may lead to an update of the configuration or the software to fix the issue. For non-blocking cases the fix can be included in one of the next releases. For blocking cases Service Manager or Management Board may decide to update the system immediately.
- Change requests are collected on a wish list. The Management Board may propose them as extensions and find a way to finance the extension if e.g. requested by a user/project/community or of common interest.
- The help desk operator informs the user about the answer, fix or workaround, or decision.
