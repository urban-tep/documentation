Operational procedure for dataset upload
----------------------------------------

An expert user may have a dataset that either this user wants to use on the platform together with other datasets and processors available on the platform. Or the user may have an urban dataset that is of common interest and shall be published and made available to other users on the platform. The procedure may be initiated by an expert user filling the form in "Develop and offer content".

* The help desk operator is automatically informed about the new ticket.
* If necessary, the operator informs the Service Manager or the Management Board about the request and waits for a decision.
* The help desk operator informs the processing centre operator(s) and if necessary also the portal operator and the visualisation and analysis tool operator.
* The processing centre operator communicates with the user if necessary. The operator ingests the data e.g. by harvesting from a remote location, or by offering an FTP drop-down point to the expert user. The operator either makes it available as dataset for processing to only this user, or prepares it for presentation in the WMS.
* In case of a public dataset the portal operator and the visualisation and analysis tool operator configure the new data source as new layer and optionally as application.
* The help desk operator informs the user about the finalisation of the configuration.
