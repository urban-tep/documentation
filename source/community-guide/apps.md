# Thematic Applications

## Overview

A *Thematic App* is a specific version of the geobrowser, in which specific parameters are pre-defined, in order to serve a specific thematic.
It is defined by a list of services offerings, such as:

> - web widget,
> - map layer,
> - map background,
> - data series,
> - wps services

Thematic apps can be searched using filters defined by the user, such as:

> - **Free text**: search within title and description of the thematic app

The search is performed amongst thematic apps which are accessible to the current user.

The pre-defined thematics are:

> - GLobal Urban Footprint 2012
> - Timescan Landsat 2015
> - Data Subsetting
> - Worldpop

All users also have an application dedicated to the management of all items he owns (see {ref}`app_workspace`).
It is call **My worskpace** and will give to the user the ability to manage (edit / share / delete) all items he owns amongst WPS services, data collections, data packages, WPS jobs.

From this "workspace", users can also manage (create / edit / delete) their own *Thematic App* (see {ref}`app_workspace`).
