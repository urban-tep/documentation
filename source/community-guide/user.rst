See your accountings
--------------------

The accounting panel on your profile gives your current credit balance, as well as the list of all transactions associated to your account:

- credit transactions
- debit transactions reported by wps providers for the wps jobs you created, associated to a deposit

.. figure:: ../includes/user_profile_accounting.png
	:figclass: img-border
	:scale: 80%

.. _deposit:
Deposit
~~~~~~~

A deposit transaction is stored when the user execute a job process using as balance the quotation returned first by the processing service for the selected parameters (it implies that the wps provider implemented the **quotation mode**). Deposit transactions can be *active* or *closed*. An **active deposit** is accounted when calculating your account balance (covering the possible debit transactions associated to the same process). A **closed deposit** is not accounted when calculating your account balance (but does not cover anymore the possible debit transactions associated to the same process). A deposit is automatically set from *active* to *closed* when the job process is failed or when the job is succeeded with at least one transaction recorded from the wps provider.

Transaction policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The current policy for a wps job process accounting is that the total amount debited to the user corresponds to the real usage of the wps process and cannot be greather than the estimated deposit.
