GeoBrowser area for data and Cloud processing services
======================================================

GeoBrowser
----------

.. figure:: ../../includes/geobrowser.png
	:figclass: img-border img-max-width


The GeoBrowser differ from one thematic application to another. It can be composed of:

	- a `Map`_, where the user can make search query and see results
	- layers that can be displayed on the map
	- `Contexts`_ links
	- `Results`_ tab (initialy hidden)
	- `Processing services tab`_ (initialy hidden)

Map
~~~

The map is just a simple map, on which you can zoom in, zoom out and navigate.

Some buttons maybe used to interact with the map:

-  |geobrowser_button_search.png| search area
-  |geobrowser_button_plus.png| Zoom in
-  |geobrowser_button_minus.png| Zoom out
-  |geobrowser_button_query.png| Open query search tab
-  |geobrowser_button_polygon.png| Edit the search bbox by drawing a polygon on the map
-  |geobrowser_button_recbox.png| Edit the search bbox by drawing a rectangle on the map
-  |geobrowser_button_fullscreen.png| Put the map in full screen
-  |geobrowser_button_wkt.png| Allow to enter a WKT to be displayed on the map as bounding box
-  |geobrowser_button_meter.png| Measure an area
-  |geobrowser_button_geocoding.png| Geocoding tool
-  |geobrowser_button_layers.png| Change the background of the map | Select layers to be displayed.

Search area
***********
From the geobrowser, a search area can be accessed by clicking on the |geobrowser_button_search.png| button. This expands a view containing all search parameters associated to the current catalogue on which the search will be performed.
Some parameters are just free text, others can be chosen from a list, and some parameters can be filled from the geobrowser. This is the case of:

- the temporal parameter which can be filled by moving the temporal bar present on the geobrowser.

.. figure:: ../../includes/geobrowser_timebar.png
	:figclass: img-border img-max-width

- the geographical area which can be filled either from the bbox drawn on the map using |geobrowser_button_polygon.png|, |geobrowser_button_recbox.png|, |geobrowser_button_placemark.png| or by uploading a shapefile, a kml or geojson file, using the import button |geobrowser_button_wkt.png|.

	This section describe the area of interest definition by geometry.

.. req:: TS-FUN-300
	:show:

	This section describe the area of interest definition by uploading a vector based file.


.. tip:: in the *Search Term* field supported wildcards are '*', which matches any character sequence (including the empty one), and '?', which matches any single character.

It is also possible to add layers on the map:

Data Results layer
******************

Display the results (orange polygons) of the current search or context.

Area of interest
*****************

.. figure:: ../../includes/aoi.png
	:align: center
	:figclass: img-container-border
	:scale: 80%


Area of interest may be defined by the user using the tools to draw a polygon or a rectangle on the map (see `Map`_). Once set, the search will be automatically updated with data corresponding to this AOI.

Area of interest external definition
````````````````````````````````````

Complex Area of interest can be defined by uploading or referencing a vector based file:

- shapefile (limited to 1MB)
- kml (limited to 1MB)

Area of Interest according to processing service
````````````````````````````````````````````````

Area of Interest may be directly used to fill bounding box parameters exposed by Processing services.
For that, you can use the |get_param_from_map_button.png| button, displayed along the parameter input field. Clicking on it will allow directly to fill the input with the value of the current search bounding box.



Geocoding tool
**************

.. figure:: ../../includes/geobrowser_geocoding_1.png
	:align: center
	:figclass: img-container-border
	:scale: 80%

Users can use the Geocoding tool to perform a search by a location (like a city, a region, a place, and so on), see the location on the map, and perform a spatial filter on that location. 
By writing a location, a first search produces a list of possible results in a dropdown list. Users can click on a result, and the relative footprint is shown on the map (or a bounding box if the footprint is not available).
The popup of the location footprint offers the way to perform a search in the catalog with the location used as a spatial filter. Users can also decide to perform a bounding box spatial filter or a polygon spatial filter (figure 3). Note that, for search performance reasons, the searching polygon is simpler than the original footprint polygon (in matter of polygon points).

Contexts
~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: ../../includes/geobrowser_contexts.png
	:figclass: img-border

Some pre-defined context are accessible on the top of the map.
One context is the result of a query on a specific catalog with pre-defined search parameters.
The existing pre-defined contexts are:

- EO data
- EO processing
- Publications
- Community

Results
~~~~~~~

.. figure:: ../../includes/geobrowser_resulttab.png
	:figclass: img-border img-max-width

The result tab is divided in two parts:

- On the left, the **Results Table** showing the list of current results displayed on the map. Results are paginatd, only 20 items are displayed, select another page to discover more products.
- On the right, the **Features Basket** showing all data in the current basket as well as the data package view, showing all available data packages for the current user with the possibility to load it / use as search.

.. req:: TS-ICD-110
	:show:

	This section describes the data package web widget.

Results can be dragged fron the left table to the basket. Then the basket can be saved as a new data package and shared with other users.
Saved Data packages can then be loaded into the basket. (see :doc:`data <../data>` for more details)


Cloud Processing
----------------

Processing services tab can be expanded by clicking on *Processing Services* on the right of the map.
It is composed of two sub tabs.

Processing services tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tab contains the list of available Processing Services. Usually, only 20 Processing services are displayed. If you are looking for a specific one, you can filter the results using the **Filter services** input. Each Processing Service can be opened to display more information such as: name, service description, publisher name, classification, output description but also the list of parameters to fill in order to create a new job associated to this service.

.. req:: TS-FUN-250
	:show:

	This section describes the processing service discovery web widget.

.. req:: TS-ICD-030
	:show:

Jobs tab
~~~~~~~~

This tab contains the list of available jobs associated to your user.
Details on jobs can be accessed by clicking on the title of the job.

.. figure:: ../../includes/geobrowser_jobs.png
	:figclass: img-border

.. req:: TS-ICD-030
	:show:

	This section describes how to access information on a succesful job.
