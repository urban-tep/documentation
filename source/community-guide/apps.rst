Thematic Applications
---------------------

Overview
========

A *Thematic App* is a specific version of the geobrowser, in which specific parameters are pre-defined, in order to serve a specific thematic.
It is defined by a list of services offerings, such as:

	- web widget,
	- map layer,
	- map background,
	- data series,
	- wps services

Discovery
=========

A discovery page, dedicated to the search of existing/accessible Thematic apps can be accessed from the home page.

Thematic apps can be searched using filters defined by the user, such as:

	- **Free text**: search within title and description of the thematic app

The search is performed amongst thematic apps which are accessible to the current user.

The pre-defined thematics are:

	- GLobal Urban Footprint 2012
	- Timescan Landsat 2015
	- Data Subsetting
	- Worldpop

All users also have an application dedicated to the management of all items he owns (see :ref:`app_workspace`).
It is call **My worskpace** and will give to the user the ability to manage (edit / share / delete) all items he owns amongst WPS services, data collections, data packages, WPS jobs.

From this "workspace", users can also manage (create / edit / delete) their own *Thematic App* (see :ref:`app_workspace`).
