Development VM and processing centre for local test, deployment, and application
:::

Develop and test your own processor in this VM, describe parameters and calling convention in a processor descriptor XML file, and package and upload it to one of the Urban TEP processing centres for concurrent application on large datasets. The VM may be hosted in the cloud of a processing centre or locally in a virtual box of your desktop machine.
